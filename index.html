        </h3>
        <p>The original website <a href="https://flagmatic.org">Flagmatic.org</a> is down, so I set up this temporary page. The latest version of Sage that I know Flagmatic runs on (and gives approximately correct answers) is Sage-7.3beta3 (so Sage-7.2 if you want a released version).
        </p>

        <p>
          Flagmatic is a package for computing bounds for Tur√°n type problems. The structures it supports are multiple: graphs, 3-regular hypergraphs, directed graphs, and multigraphs.  It was developed by Emil R. Vaughan while working with Victor Falgas-Ravry (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1623">see their paper</a>). Flagmatic uses the flag algebra calculus introduced in <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/files/flag.pdf">Razborov in 2007</a>. By now, there are various resources where you can find out more about the method of flag algebras and its uses so I won't list more papers here.
        </p>

        <p>
          One last piece of information. The version of Flagmatic that this site links to is not Emil's original version. I had to modify a few functions and installation settings to keep up with the novelties in Sage as it developed. At the same time, I was altering Flagmatic-2.0 to be more functional (with <a href="http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~maskat/">Oleg Pikhurko</a>). Therefore, I only kept alive the version of Flagmatic that I needed (I used to refer to it as Flagmatic-dev). Now I simplified things, and only keep "Flagmatic" alive. Flagmatic has the functionality of Flagmatic-dev and more -- I still alter it from time to time -- and it works with the latest version of Sage. While this means that new functionality is available, I did not always test extensively the interaction of new code with the old code. Hence bugs could exist that were not present in Emil's Flagmatic-2.0. Please keep this in mind! And of course, if you find a bug (of any kind) please feel free to comment on my Github or email me. Thank you.

        <p>
          See the README file in the Github repository. It gives a short and hopefully working sequence of steps to get Flagmatic set up in Sage.

          You can find the original User Guide by Emil <a href="https://github.com/jsliacan/flagmatic/blob/master/doc/UsersGuide.pdf">here</a>. The same folder contains a User Guide for the <code>dev</code> version of Flagmatic. In the dev user guide, ignore the installation instructions (they should work though).

        </h3>
        <p>
          The very first version of Flagmatic was Sage independent, and it is still hosted on its <a href="http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~ev/flagmatic/">original website</a>. The website contains a list of results obtained or re-obtained with Flagmatic and Flagmatic-2.0 (until Emil stopped maintaining it).

        <p>
          In 2013, Emil Vaughan (<a href="https://github.com/emil79" class="user-mention">@emil79</a>) wrote the original version of Flagmatic-2.0. He stopped maintaining it when he left academia.
